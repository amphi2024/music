Amphi Music is a free and open-source, cross-platform music player.
It plays all your music in most popular formats — no conversion required.
You can easily edit song, album, and artist information.
Once your music library is set up, you can sync your data across devices via a self-hosted server, letting you access and play your library on any platform.
If you already use Amphi Notes, Amphi Photos, and Amphi Cloud, your notes, photos, and files can also be synced through the same server.
